=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

The experiment has been applied on 30 subjects.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Variables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final dataSet contains 68 variables: 

1. SUBJECT: this is the subject identification. 

2. ACTIVITY: the type of activity that a subject does

3 to 68: several measurements described here in below. 
If "XYZ" appears in the name, that means there are actually 3 variables in the data set, 1 for each direction: x, y, z.
Each measurement brings 2 variables: one for the mean of this measurement, mean(), and one for the standard deviation
of the measurement, sdv().  

Example: tBodyAcc-XYZ (in the list) actually corresponds to 6 variable in the dataset: tBodyAcc mean() -X, tBodyAcc sdv() -X,
tBodyAcc mean() -Y, tBodyAcc sdv() -Y etc..
